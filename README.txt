This is short explanation of the project.

If you opened this file for instructions to the game the input is [action] [target] (look out the familiar_face)

I had no experience with AI and wanted to try it somewhere.
Btw Thank you for this opportunity and hackathon itself!!!

My womp womps down here
So I had a hard time implementing it from openai for example (which shocked me after realizing its not free)
I tried some free sources like hugging face, but the quality was bad and most of them required 
transformers which looked pretty hard to me... 
On top of that I needed to learn tuning which I couldn't understand how to do it ;D

Anyways, I still wanted to present any text-based game, so I made a concept-like-game
It is very short but its aim to introduce user the kazakh culture.
I hope I will be honored to get any kiind of feedback!!!
